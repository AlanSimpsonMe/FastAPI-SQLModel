Make sure you're using Python 3.6 or later. In Windows you might need to execute `py -V` to get the version number. On a Mac try `python 3 -V`. If they don't work, replace `py` or `python3` below with whatever does work for you. In VS Code terminal (or whatever command line you're using), folow these steps to create a virtual environment and install dependencies.

Windows
-------

`py -m venv venv
venv\scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt`

Mac
---

`python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt`
